# AidCompass, Your Disaster Relief Partner

AidCompass is an AI-powered disaster relief organization that provides data-driven solutions for early warnings, rescue operations, damage assessment, and resource allocation.

## Problem Statement
The evolution of AI has been nothing short of extraordinary. From humble beginnings, machines now learn, adapt, and even create with startling sophistication.  Let's focus on using this power to address the challenges we face. 

The greatest innovations are those that solve real-world problems and make a positive difference. This hackathon is a chance to create solutions that improve lives, streamline processes that make a tangible difference in healthcare, education and sustainability, and countless other fields for the next billion users. Let's make this hackathon a testament to a future where AI isn't just intelligent – it's transformative.

 Enhance disaster relief and response efforts by leveraging satellite imagery during disasters like floods and wildfires, integrating existing geospatial information, and utilizing environmental data for affected regions.
My goal was to create a model that could more quickly and more accurately identify the hardest hit areas in order to better target disaster relief.


## Solution

To address this challenge, I propose the development of an AI-powered web application. This application aims to provide early warnings, damage assessment, and resource allocation support during both wildfires and floods. By leveraging satellite imagery, geospatial information, and environmental data, my solution can detect early signs of disasters, and assess the damage level remotely, and optimize resource deployment for efficient response efforts. This web application will provide 
•	Timely warnings to authorities and communities for both floods and wildfires, facilitating proactive response measures such as evacuation and disaster preparedness.
•	Assists rescue teams and emergency responders in prioritizing response efforts, directing resources to areas most in need of assistance for both floods and wildfires.
